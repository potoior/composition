<p>	Dear Mr. Smith,</p>
<p>	Hope this letter finds you in good spirits and health. I&#39;ve received your email asking for help with <strong>your oral report on an ancient Chinese scientist </strong>. It&#39;s my pleasure to share some of my personal suggestions.</p>
<p>	To start with, <strong>deciding the candidates should be addressed first</strong>, and I think it would be a <strong>good idea to choose a scientist whose field of searching you are interested in</strong>. Furthermore, I strongly recommend that <strong>you watch some videos or attend related lectures online</strong>, which will make your preparation <strong>feasible and effective</strong>. Finally, <strong>selecting an appropriate style is always necessary</strong>, as it makes your report both <strong>impressive and coherent</strong>.</p>
<p>	Hope these suggestions will be helpful to you. Please don&#39;t hesitate to let me know if you have any problem. I&#39;m looking forward to your good news.</p>
